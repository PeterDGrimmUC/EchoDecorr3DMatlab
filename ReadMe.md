# Scripts for ultrasound echo decorrelation imaging
### Important: You must install a C++ compiler and run MexBuild.m before using the package
The script MexBuild compiles all mex functions and places the binaries in the 'Util' subpackage.

It should be platform independent, if necessary compiler flags can be altered by changing the string compilationFlags in MexBuild.m.

see [this matlab article for supported compilers](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/supported-compilers.html).
